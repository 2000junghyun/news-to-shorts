A certificate of deposit (CD) allows you to lock in a competitive rate on your savings and help your balance grow. However, rates vary widely across financial institutions, so it’s important to ensure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a CD. The following is a breakdown of\nCD rates\ntoday and where to find the best offers.\nOverview of CD rates today\nHistorically, longer-term CDs offered higher interest rates than shorter-term CDs. Generally, this is because banks would pay better rates to encourage savers to keep their money on deposit longer. However, in today’s economic climate, the opposite is true.\nAs of July 20, 2025, the highest CD rate is 5.5% APY, offered by Gainbridge® on its 5-year CD. There is a $1000 minimum opening deposit required.\nHow much interest can I earn with a CD?\nThe amount of interest you can earn from a CD depends on the\nannual percentage rate\n(APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (CD interest typically compounds daily or monthly).\nSay you invest $1,000 in a one-year CD with 1.81% APY, and interest compounds monthly. At the end of that year, your balance would grow to $1,018.25 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus $18.25 in interest.\nNow let’s say you choose a one-year CD that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.74 over the same period, which includes $40.74 in interest.\nThe more you deposit in a CD, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a one-year CD at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance when the CD matures would be $10,407.42, meaning you’d earn $407.42 in interest. ​​\nRead more:\nWhat is a good CD rate?\nTypes of CDs\nWhen choosing a CD, the interest rate is usually top of mind. However, the rate isn’t the only factor you should consider. There are several types of CDs that offer different benefits, though you may need to accept a slightly lower interest rate in exchange for more flexibility. Here’s a look at some of the common types of CDs you can consider beyond traditional CDs:\nBump-up CD\n:\nThis type of CD allows you to request a higher interest rate if your bank's rates go up during the account’s term. However, you’re usually allowed to \"bump up\" your rate just once.\nNo-penalty CD\n:\nAlso known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty.\nJumbo CD\n:\nThese CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In today’s CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much.\nBrokered CD\n:\nAs the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank. Brokered CDs can sometimes offer higher rates or more flexible terms, but they also carry more risk and might not be FDIC-insured.\nRead More\nThe best CD rates on the market right now: Lock in up to 4.4% APY for the rest of the year\nWe identified the best CD rates and accounts available today based on interest rates, fees, and more. See our top picks across 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month terms.\nWhat is a step-up CD, and how does it work?\nStep-up CDs increase the interest rate at regular intervals throughout the CD’s term. However, you will likely find better interest rates on your savings elsewhere. Here’s what to know about step-up CDs.\nWhat is an add-on CD?\nAn add-on CD lets you make additional contributions to your balance after the initial funding. However, it’s important to understand the pros and cons of add-on CDs before opening an account.\nUnderstanding CD terms: How long should you lock in your money?\nCD terms range from a few months to several years. So how do you choose the best CD term? This guide will walk you through it.\nAre CD rates going up or down in 2025?\nAre CD rates expected to go up or down this year? Here’s what could happen, according to experts.\nHow to avoid taxes on CD interest\nTypically, you must pay taxes on CD interest. But there are ways of getting around this rule.
