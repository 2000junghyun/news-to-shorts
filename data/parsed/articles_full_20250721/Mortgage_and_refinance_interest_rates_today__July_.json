According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate has only shifted up one basis points to\n6.72%\n. Meanwhile, the 20-year fixed rate has inched down by four basis points to\n6.52%\n, and the 15-year fixed rate has increased by seven basis points to\n5.97%\n.\nAccording to the Mortgage Bankers Association's July forecast, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is set to decrease to 6.7% by the end of the year and 6.6% halfway through 2026, so there is no expectation that mortgage interest rates will plummet in the near future. Prioritize\nbuying a house\nwhen it makes the most sense for your situation, rather than relying on lower future interest rates.\nDig deeper:\n2025 housing market — Is it a good time to buy a house?\nCurrent mortgage rates\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n30-year fixed:\n6.72%\n20-year fixed:\n6.52%\n15-year fixed:\n5.97%\n5/1 ARM:\n7.42%\n7/1 ARM:\n7.4%\n30-year VA:\n6.33%\n15-year VA:\n5.69%\n5/1 VA:\n6.49%\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nCurrent mortgage refinance rates\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n30-year fixed:\n6.70%\n20-year fixed:\n6.60%\n15-year fixed:\n5.67%\n5/1 ARM:\n7.59%\n7/1 ARM:\n7.46%\n30-year VA:\n6.32%\n15-year VA:\n6.15%\n5/1 VA:\n6.43%\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\nRead more:\nIs now a good time to refinance your mortgage?\nRefinance interest rates\nUp Next\nWhich is more important, your interest rate or house price?\nWhat is the best time of year to buy a house?\nHow much does it cost to refinance a mortgage?\nMonthly mortgage payment calculator\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\nOur\nfree mortgage calculator\nalso considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n30-year vs. 15-year fixed mortgage rates\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.72%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.97% today. When deciding between a\n15-year and a 30-year mortgage\n, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\nLet’s say you get a\n$300,000 mortgage\n. With a 30-year term and a 6.72% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about\n$1,940,\nand you’d pay\n$398,334\nin interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.97% rate, your monthly payment would jump to\n$2,527\n. But you’d only pay\n$154,808\nin interest over the years.\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\nWith a\nfixed-rate mortgage\n, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\nAn\nadjustable-rate mortgage\nkeeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\nDig deeper:\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\nHow to get a low mortgage rate\nMortgage lenders typically give the\nlowest mortgage rates\nto people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more,\nimproving your credit score\n, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\nHow to choose a mortgage lender\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for\nmortgage preapproval\nwith three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the\nmortgage annual percentage rate (APR)\n— this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\nLearn more:\nBest mortgage lenders for first-time home buyers\nCurrent mortgage rates: FAQs\nWhat is a mortgage interest rate at right now?\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 6.72%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.97%.
