Here's the real key to long-term gains\nMoneywise\nSat, Jul 19, 2025, 8:12 AM\n5 min read\nIn This Article:\nGLAXF\nGSK\nGOOG\nEtienne DE MALGLAIVE/Getty Images\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nWarren Buffett is one of the most renowned investors of our time. So, it’s easy to forget that he was once a beginner too.\nBuffett claims he bought his first stock at age 11, then spent eight years focusing on stock price movements instead of studying the underlying companies.\nDon't miss\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now\nbecome a landlord for as little as $100\n— and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are\n5 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\nYou don’t have to be a millionaire to gain access to\nthis $1B private real estate fund\n. In fact, you can get started with as little as $10 — here’s how\n“I had the whole wrong idea,” Buffett said in a 2022 interview with journalist Charlie Rose. “I thought the important thing was to predict what a stock would do and predict the stock market.” But when Buffett was 19 or 20 years old, he read a book that would change his perspective forever: “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham.\nInstead of charting stocks or \"stock picking,\" Graham advocated for the valuation of underlying companies. He theorized that stock prices eventually follow a company’s financial performance. This simple philosophy shifted Buffett’s view on investing forever.\n“I realized that I was doing it exactly the wrong way,” Buffett said. “I rejiggered my mind when I read the book.”\nThis philosophy has worked for Buffett, but not everyone has time to read 500 pages of financial analysis a day. Here are three ways to level up your investing depending on how much time you have.\nDo your research\nBuffett once famously said that he reads 500 pages a day. While this might not be what every investor needs to do, you should think about spending more time with news and analysis from reputable sources.\nBuffett’s approach favors analysis based on understanding the companies you’re investing in, their industry, and the forces impacting their potential for growth. However, technical analysis — focusing on the numbers — also has a place for the modern investor.\nWhen you learn to balance both data and investment philosophy, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a savvy market player.\nIn short: where you get your stock market info from matters.\nWith\nMoby\n, you can get advice from expert former hedge fund analysts, with a 30-day money-back guarantee. In four years, across almost 400 stock picks, Moby's recommendations have beaten the S&P 500 by almost 12% on average.\nStory continues\nMoby’s team spends hundreds of hours sifting through financial news and data to provide you with stock and crypto reports\ndelivered straight to you\n. Their research keeps you up-to-the-minute on market shifts and can help you reduce the guesswork behind choosing stocks and ETFs.\nPlus, their reports are easy to understand for beginners, so you can\nbecome a smarter investor in just five minutes\n.\nTrust the experts\nAside from doing your own research, it can pay to invest in professional advice.\nEven Buffett surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors at Berkshire Hathaway. Everyone has areas of expertise, but no one knows everything.\nWith this in mind, an expert advisor can help you raise your game. As Buffett once said, “Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you’ll drift in that direction.”\n“In looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you.”\nIf you’re unsure which path to take amid today’s market uncertainty, it might be a good time to\nconnect with a financial advisor\nthrough Advisor.com.\nThis online platform connects you with vetted financial advisors best suited to help you develop a plan for your new wealth.\nJust answer a few quick questions about yourself and your finances and the platform will match you with an experienced financial professional.

The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way.”\nA passive approach might not produce spectacular wins, but it can be a low-risk option for the investor who is simply looking to build a reliable nest egg for retirement.\nWhat to read next\nHow much cash do you plan to keep on hand after you retire?
