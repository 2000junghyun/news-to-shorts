When you compare a\nhome equity line of credit\ninterest rate to other borrowing options, you are likely to find it is among your most affordable choices.\nOf course, that's because it is a\nsecond mortgage\n, with your home pledged as collateral. That gives you a lower interest rate compared to non-secured loans. But it also comes with an essential responsibility. You'll want to use your HELOC for worthy expenses — and repay it promptly. Your house is too important to risk.\nNow, let's check today's HELOC rate.\nDig deeper:\nHow to use a HELOC to pay off debt (and when it makes sense)\nHELOC rates Saturday, July 19, 2025\nAccording to\nBank of America\n, the country's highest-volume HELOC lender, today's average APR on a 10-year draw HELOC remains at\n8.72%\n. That is a variable rate that kicks in after a six-month introductory APR, which is 6.49% in most states.\nHomeowners have a staggering amount of value tied up in their houses — more than $34 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the third-largest amount of home equity on record.\nWith mortgage rates lingering in the high 6% range, homeowners are not going to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling a house may not be an option. Why let go of your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage?\nAccessing some of that value with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative.\nRead more:\nHow to get a HELOC in 6 steps\nHow lenders determine HELOC interest rates\nHELOC interest rates are different from primary mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which today is 7.50%. If a lender added 1% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 8.50%.\nLenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a\nHELOC or home equity loan\n, so it pays to shop. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home.\nAnd average national HELOC rates can include \"introductory\" rates that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate.\nHow a HELOC works\nYou don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access the equity in your home. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage, such as a home equity line of credit.\nThe\nbest HELOC lenders\noffer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat.\nMeanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage like the wealth-building machine you are.\nLook for introductory rates, but be aware of a rate adjustment later\nToday,\nFourLeaf Credit Union\nis offering a HELOC rate of 6.49% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate later. When shopping lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity.\nThe power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow.\nHELOC rates today: FAQs\nWhat is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now?\nRates vary so much from one lender to the next that it's hard to pin down a magic number. You may see rates from nearly 7% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent a shopper you are.\nIs it a good idea to get a HELOC right now?\nFor homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a chunk of equity in their house, it's probably\none of the best times to get a HELOC\n. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation — if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is likely not worth taking on long-term debt.\nWhat is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit?\nIf you take out the full $50,000 from a line of credit on a $400,000 home, your payment may be around $395 per month with a variable interest rate beginning at 8.75%. That's for a HELOC with a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment period. That sounds good, but remember, it winds up being a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and pay back the balance in a much shorter period of time.\nRead more\nHow to get a HELOC in 6 simple steps\nTo get a HELOC, you must meet equity, credit score, and DTI ratio requirements and then go through the application process.
