The Federal Reserve began cutting the federal funds rate in 2024, and as a result, deposit rates (including money market account rates) have been falling. It’s more important than ever to compare MMA rates and ensure you earn as much as possible on your balance.\nOverview of money market account rates today\nThe\nnational average money market account rate\nstands at 0.62%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.07%. So by historical standards, money market account rates are still quite high.\nEven so, some of the top accounts are currently offering over 4% APY. Since these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a money market account now to take advantage of today’s high rates.\nHere’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today:\nSee our picks for the 10 best money market accounts available today>>\nAdditionally, the table below features some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.\nHow much will $10,000 make in a money market account?\nThe amount of interest you can earn from a money market account depends on the\nannual percentage rate\n(APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (money market account interest typically compounds daily).\nSay you put $10,000 in an MMA at the average interest rate of 0.64% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $10,064.20 — your initial $10,000 deposit, plus $64.20 in interest.\nNow let’s say you choose a high-yield money market account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $10,408.08 over the same period, which includes $408.08 in interest.\nFrequently asked questions about money market account rates\nWhat is the downside of a money market account?\nCompared to a traditional savings account, a money market account may come with more restrictions. For example, money market accounts often require a higher minimum balance in order to earn the best interest rate and/or avoid fees. Certain MMAs may also limit the number of withdrawals you can make per month (typically six).\nWhich bank gives 7% interest on savings accounts?\nIn general, there are no banks that offer a 7% interest rate on money market accounts or any other type of deposit account. That said, you may be able to find local banks and credit unions running limited-time promotional rates on certain accounts, which could be as high as 7%. However, promotional rates at this level often apply to a limited balance.\nRead more:\nDo 7% interest savings accounts exist anymore?\nRead More\nThe best CD rates on the market right now: Lock in up to 4.4% APY for the rest of the year\nWe identified the best CD rates and accounts available today based on interest rates, fees, and more.
