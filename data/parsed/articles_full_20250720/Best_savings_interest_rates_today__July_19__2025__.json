The Federal Reserve cut its target rate three times in late 2024, which means savings interest rates are falling. So it’s important to be sure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a savings account. The following is a breakdown of savings interest rates today and where to find the best offers.\nOverview of savings interest rates today\nThe\nnational average savings account rate\nstands at 0.38%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.06%.\nAlthough the national average savings interest rate is fairly low compared to other investments, the best savings rates on the market today are much higher. In fact, some of the top accounts are currently offering 4% APY and up.\nAs of July 19, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.3% APY. This rate is offered Openbank and requires no minimum deposit.\nHere is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:\nHow much interest can I earn with a savings account?\nThe amount of interest you can earn from a savings account depends on the\nannual percentage rate\n(APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (savings account interest typically compounds daily).\nSay you put $1,000 in a savings account at the average interest rate of 0.42% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,004.12 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $4.12 in interest.\nNow let’s say you choose a\nhigh-yield savings account\nthat offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest.\nThe more you deposit in a savings account, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a high-yield savings account at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance after one year would be $10,408.08, meaning you’d earn $408.08 in interest. ​​\nRead more:\nWhat is a good savings account rate?\nRead More\n23 savings accounts with interest rates of 4% APY and higher (updated weekly)\nIs it possible to find savings accounts with interest rates of 4% or more?
