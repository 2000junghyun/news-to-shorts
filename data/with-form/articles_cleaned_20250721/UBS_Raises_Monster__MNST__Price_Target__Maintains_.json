UBS raised its price target on Monster Beverage Corporation. (NASDAQ:MNST) to $64 from $63 on July 17, maintaining a\nNeutral\nrating as the firm continues to take a measured view of the energy drink giant’s near-term prospects. The modest adjustment reflects incremental optimism around the company’s distribution gains and innovation pipeline, but also suggests limited room for outperformance at current levels.\nUBS Raises Monster (MNST) Price Target, Maintains Neutral Rating\nMonster, which has faced intensified competition from new entrants and legacy beverage rivals alike, has been leaning on international expansion and product extensions to maintain momentum. UBS analysts noted that while those initiatives are showing progress, the overall U.S. market has grown more crowded, putting pressure on shelf space and pricing.\nThe company’s recent launch of alcoholic offerings under The Beast Unleashed brand has drawn interest, but UBS appears to be waiting for more evidence of meaningful revenue contribution before revising its broader outlook. Monster shares have traded in a relatively tight range over the past quarter, as investors weigh category growth against margin pressures from higher input costs.\nWith the stock hovering below 8.5% of the new target, the neutral call underscores a wait-and-see approach from UBS as the company navigates a shifting competitive landscape.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MNST as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
