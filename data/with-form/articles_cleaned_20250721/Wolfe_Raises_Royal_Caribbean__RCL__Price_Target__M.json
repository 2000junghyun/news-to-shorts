Wolfe analysts cited improved onboard spending, healthy booking curves, and continued strength in premium cabin sales as key reasons for their bullish stance.\nRoyal Caribbean has been among the top performers in the travel sector this year, fueled by a surge in international travel and a shift in consumer discretionary spending toward experiences over goods. Wolfeâ€™s update suggests that the stock still has room to run, especially as capacity returns to pre-pandemic levels and new ship deliveries drive earnings growth.\nWith forward guidance already raised in previous quarters, the focus now shifts to whether Royal Caribbean can sustain momentum through 2025 amid macro uncertainty and rising costs. For now, analysts appear confident the cruise line remains on a favorable course.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RCL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
