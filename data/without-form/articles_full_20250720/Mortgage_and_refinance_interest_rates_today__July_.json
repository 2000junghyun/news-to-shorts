According to Zillow, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate shifted up by one basis point, sitting at\n6.72%\n. Meanwhile the 15-year fixed rate is up seven basis points to\n5.97%.\nIf you are looking to\nbuy a house\n, it could be smart to lock in time to lock in an interest rate with a mortgage lender while mortgage rates are flat. Just make sure to choose one with a\nrate buydown option\nso if you lock in a rate now, you won't risk getting stuck with a higher rate in a few weeks. Rather, with a buydown program, you can re-lock your interest rate if market rates decrease before you buy the house.\nRead more: Looking for a lender with a rate buydown program?

Affordability calculator\nYou locked in a low mortgage rate — now you want to move. What should you do?\nFree mortgage calculator\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\nFor a deeper dive, you can use\nYahoo's free mortgage calculator\nto see how homeowners insurance and property taxes factor into in your monthly payment estimate. You even have the option to enter costs for\nprivate mortgage insurance (PMI)\nand homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n30-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your\nhomeowners insurance\nor\nproperty taxes\n.\nThe main disadvantage to 30-year fixed mortgage rates is mortgage interest — both in the short and long term.\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term.\n15-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped from the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\nDig deeper:\n15-year vs. 30-year mortgages\nAdjustable mortgage rates: Pros and cons\nAdjustable-rate mortgages\nlock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\nLearn more:\nAdjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage\nIs now a good time to buy a house?\nFirst of all,\nnow is a relatively good time to buy a house\ncompared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\nHowever, mortgage rates are staying relatively high due to the political and economic climate. Experts don't think rates will plummet in 2025, so you might not want to base your decision on whether to buy strictly on interest rates. Recent news that home price gains are slowing, with predictions that house values may actually ease lower this year, can be part of your home buying decision.\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\nRead more:\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\nToday's mortgage rates: FAQs\nWhat is a 30-year mortgage rate right now?\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.72% right now. But keep in mind that\nmortgage rates vary by state\nand even ZIP codes. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\nAre interest rates expected to go down?\nOverall, mortgage rates are expected to lower slightly in 2025. Rates may inch up or down from day to day, but there shouldn't be a huge shift in the near future.\nAre mortgage rates dropping?\nMortgage rates are dropping slightly. Today's 30-year fixed mortgage rate has only shifted down three basis points.\nHow do I get the lowest refinance rate?\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your\ndebt-to-income ratio (DTI)\n. Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\nWeitere Infos\nMortgage and refinance interest rates today, July 17, 2025: The 30-year rate hits 6.75%\nThese are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates.
