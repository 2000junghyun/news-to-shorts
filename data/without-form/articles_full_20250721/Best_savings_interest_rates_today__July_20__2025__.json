The Federal Reserve cut its target rate three times in late 2024, which means savings interest rates are falling from their historic highs. It’s important to be sure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a savings account. The following is a breakdown of savings interest rates today and where to find the best offers.\nOverview of savings interest rates today\nThe national average savings account rate stands at 0.38%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.06%, reflecting a sharp rise in a short period of time.\nAs of July 20, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.3% APY. This rate is offered by Openbank and requires no minimum deposit.\nSince these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a\nhigh-yield savings account\nnow to take advantage of today’s high rates.\nHere is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:\nHow much interest can I earn with a savings account?\nThe amount of interest you can earn from a savings account depends on the\nannual percentage rate\n(APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (savings account interest typically compounds daily).\nSay you put $1,000 in a savings account at the average interest rate of 0.42% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,004.12 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $4.12 in interest.\nNow let’s say you choose a high-yield savings account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest.\nThe more you deposit in a savings account, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a high-yield savings account at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance after one year would be $10,408.08, meaning you’d earn $408.08 in interest. ​​\nRead more:\nWhat is a good savings account rate?\nLeer más\nHow do banks set their savings account interest rates?\nBanking rates are influenced by a variety of factors, and they can change at any time.
