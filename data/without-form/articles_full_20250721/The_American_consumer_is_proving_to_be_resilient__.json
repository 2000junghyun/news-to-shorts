This Article:\nCL=F\nJPM\nBAC\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co\nDespite weak consumer sentiment, an uptick in household debt delinquencies, and anecdotal reports of financial distress, the overarching narrative remains that\nconsumers as a whole are healthy\n, and they are spending.\nThis is important because personal consumption accounts for about\n70% of GDP\n.\nOn Thursday, we learned monthly retail sales grew 0.6% in June to $720 billion. This metric is hovering near record highs.\nRetail sales remain very strong. (Source: Census via\nFRED\n)\nThis trend was confirmed last week by\nAmerica‚Äôs largest banks\n, which know exactly how much money people have, how much they‚Äôre spending, and how they‚Äôre paying for it.\n\"The consumer basically seems to be fine,\" JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum\ntold analysts\non Tuesday. \"You see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands. But that‚Äôs always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations.\"\nBarnum acknowledged concerns about debt delinquencies but argued there was little cause for alarm.\n\"Consumer credit is primarily about the labor market,\" he explained. \"In a world with a 4.1% unemployment rate, it‚Äôs just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio, to see a lot of weakness.\"\nThe state of consumer spending can be described as cooling, but also \"still positive\" and \"still growing,\" Barnum said.\nOther banks echoed that sentiment while addressing their second-quarter profits, which beat analysts‚Äô forecasts.\n\"Consumer health remains very strong,\" Citigroup CFO Mark Mason\nsaid\n. \"We do anticipate further consumer [spending] cooling in the second half as ... tariff effects play through.\"\nJPMorgan‚Äôs debit and credit card\nspending volume in Q2\nwas up 7% from last year. Citi‚Äôs branded credit card spending volume\nincreased by 4%\n. Bank of America said its credit and debit card\nspending was up 4%\n. Wells Fargo‚Äôs purchase volume was up 4% for its debit cards and 8% for its credit cards.\nBofA card data reflects growth in spending, but the growth has been cooling. (Source: BofA)\n\"Consumers remained resilient, with healthy spending and asset quality,\" BofA CEO Brian Moynihan\nsaid\n.\n\"Consumers and businesses remain strong as unemployment remains low and inflation remains in check, credit card spending growth softened very slightly in the second quarter, but is still up year over year,\" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf\nsaid\n.\nThe big picture üñºÔ∏è\nAs you‚Äôll see below in TKer‚Äôs weekly review of the macro crosscurrents, card spending data from early July shows that consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip.\nContinua a leggere\nJust because consumers have\nbeen\nresilient doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll\nremain\nresilient.\nAs we‚Äôve been discussing for months, the economic data, while growing,\ncontinues to cool\n.\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean the economy is doomed to fall into a\nrecession\n. Rather, it‚Äôs just an acknowledgement and recognition that it has gotten\nharder to argue that growth is destiny\n.\nFor now, we‚Äôll just have to keep watching the data ‚Äî\nespecially the hard data\n. Because so far, the economy continues to hold up, supported by healthy consumer spending.\nReview of the macro crosscurrents üîÄ\nThere were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our\nlast review\n:\nüëé\nInflation ticks higher\n. The\nConsumer Price Index\n(CPI) in June was up 2.7% from a year ago. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 2.9%, up from the prior month‚Äôs 2.8% rate.\n(Source:\nGreg Daco\n)\nOn a month-over-month basis, CPI was up 0.3% and core CPI increased just 0.2%. If you annualize the three-month trend in the monthly figures ‚Äî a reflection of the short-term trend in prices ‚Äî core CPI climbed 2.4%.\n(Source:\nGreg Daco\n)\n‚õΩÔ∏è\nGas prices tick lower\n. From\nAAA\n: \"In the thick of summer, gas prices are laying low with the national average for a gallon of regular going down one cent from a week ago to $3.16. Pump prices have dipped to match the summer of 2021, the last time seasonal gas prices were this low. Meanwhile, a low-pressure system off the Gulf Coast has the potential, albeit low, to strengthen, and it‚Äôs something to watch as it moves westward. This time of year, tropical activity can have an effect on gas prices if there‚Äôs damage to refineries or if local flooding affects gasoline distribution or demand.\"\n(Source:\nAAA\n)\nFor more on energy prices, read:\nHigher oil prices meant something different in the past\nüõ¢Ô∏è\nüõçÔ∏è\nShopping ticks higher\n.\nRetail sales\nincreased 0.6% in June to $720.1 billion.\n(Source: Census via\nFRED\n)\nGrowth was broad-based, with just a couple of categories showing modest declines.\n(Source:\nWells Fargo\n)\nüí≥\nCard spending data is holding up\n. From JPM: \"As of 11 Jul 2025, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 6.6% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 11 Jul 2025, our estimate of the US Census July control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.63%.\"\n(Source: JPMorgan)\nFrom BofA: \"Total card spending per HH was up 4.5% y/y in the week ending Jul 12, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. The jump in y/y growth was mainly due to the timing shift in Prime Day & other promotions (Jul 8-11 '25 vs Jul 16-17 '24). Relative to last week, online retail saw the biggest rise in y/y spending growth.\"\n(Source: BofA)\nFor more on consumer spending, read:\nAmericans have money, and they're spending it\nüõçÔ∏è\nüëç\nConsumer sentiment improves from low levels\n. From the University of Michigan‚Äôs July\nSurveys of Consumers\n: \"While sentiment reached its highest value in five months, it remains a substantial 16% below December 2024 and is well below its historical average. Short-run business conditions improved about 8%, whereas expected personal finances fell back about 4%. Consumers are unlikely to regain their confidence in the economy unless they feel assured that inflation is unlikely to worsen, for example if trade policy stabilizes for the foreseeable future.\"\n(Source:\nUniv. of Michigan\n)\nRelatively weak consumer sentiment readings appear to contradict resilient consumer spending data.\nFor more on this contradiction, read:\nWhat consumers do > what consumers say\nüôä and\nWe're taking that vacation whether we like it or not\nüõ´\nüíº\nNew unemployment claims tick lower ‚Äî but total ongoing claims tick higher\n.\nInitial claims for unemployment benefits\ndeclined to 221,000 during the week ending July 12, down from 228,000 the week prior. This metric remains at levels historically associated with economic growth.\n(Source: DoL via\nFRED\n)\nInsured unemployment, which captures those who continue to claim unemployment benefits, rose to 1.956 million during the week ending July 5. This metric is near its highest level since November 2021.\n(Source: DoL via\nFRED\n)\nSteady initial claims confirm that layoff activity remains low. Rising continued claims confirm hiring activity is weakening. This dynamic warrants close attention, as it reflects a deteriorating labor market.\nFor more context, read:\nThe hiring situation\nüß© and\nThe labor market is cooling\nüíº\nüõ†Ô∏è\nIndustrial activity improves.\nIndustrial production activity\nin June increased 0.3% from prior month levels. Manufacturing ticked up by 0.1%.\n(Source:\nFederal Reserve\n)\nFor more on economic activity cooling, read:\n9 once-hot economic charts that cooled\nüìâ\nüè†\nMortgage rates tick higher\n. According to\nFreddie Mac\n, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.75%, up from 6.72% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage inched up this week and continues to stay within a narrow range under 7%. While overall affordability headwinds persist, rate stability coupled with moderately rising inventory may sway prospective buyers to act.\"\n(Source:\nFreddie Mac\n)\nThere are\n147.8 million housing units\nin the U.S., of which 86.1 million are\nowner-occupied\nand about\n34.1 million\nare\nmortgage-free\n. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have\nfixed-rate mortgages\n, and most of those mortgages\nhave rates that were locked in\nbefore rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to the small weekly movements in home prices or mortgage rates.\nFor more on mortgages and home prices, read:\nWhy home prices and rents are creating all sorts of confusion about inflation\nüòñ\nüè†\nHomebuilder sentiment ticks higher\n. From the\nNAHB\n: \"Builder confidence for future sales expectations received a slight boost in July with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act but elevated interest rates and economic and policy uncertainty continue to act as headwinds for the housing sector. ‚Ä¶ the latest HMI survey also revealed that 38% of builders reported cutting prices in July, the highest percentage since NAHB began tracking this figure on a monthly basis in 2022. This compares with 37% of builders who reported cutting prices in June, 34% in May and 29% in April. Meanwhile, the average price reduction was 5% in July, the same as it‚Äôs been every month since last November. The use of sales incentives was 62% in July, unchanged from June.\"\n(Source:\nNAHB\n)\nüî®\nNew home construction starts rise\n. Housing starts increased 4.6% in June to an annualized rate of 1.26 million units, according to\nthe Census Bureau\n. Building permits ticked up 0.2% to an annualized rate of 1.4 million units.\n(Source:\nCensus\n)\nüè¢\nOffices remain relatively empty\n. From\nKastle Systems\n: \"Peak day office occupancy rose to 63% on Tuesday last week, only 1.2 points lower than the post-pandemic record high set in early June.. The average low was on Thursday (7/3) at 36.7%, more than 20 points lower than the previous week. New York City and Chicago experienced the largest decreases in occupancy leading up to the holiday, declining more than 30 points from the previous Thursday to 30.1% and 32.2%, respectively.\"\n(Source:\nKastle\n)\nFor more on office occupancy, read:\nThis stat about offices reminds us things are far from normal\nüè¢\nüò¨\nThis is the stuff pros are worried about\n. From BofA‚Äôs July Global Fund Manager Survey: \"Trade war triggering a global recession is still viewed as the #1 'tail risk' according to 38% of FMS investors (down from 47% in June). Inflation preventing Fed rate cuts is the 2nd biggest 'tail risk' (20%), while 14% say the biggest 'tail risk' is the US dollar slumping on capital flight.\"\n(Source: BofA)\n(Source: BofA)\nüìà\nNear-term GDP growth estimates are tracking positively\n. The\nAtlanta Fed‚Äôs GDPNow model\nsees real GDP growth rising at a 2.4% rate in Q2.\n(Source:\nAtlanta Fed\n)\nFor more on GDP and the economy, read:\n9 once-hot economic charts that cooled\nüìâ and\nYou call this a recession?\nü§®\nPutting it all together üìã\nüö®\nThe Trump administration‚Äôs\npursuit of tariffs\nthreatens to disrupt global trade, with significant implications for the U.S. economy, corporate earnings, and the stock market.\nUntil we get more clarity\n, here‚Äôs where things stand:\nEarnings look bullish\n: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by\nexpectations for years of earnings growth\n. And earnings are the\nmost important driver of stock prices\n.\nDemand is positive\n: Demand for goods and services remains\npositive\n, supported by\nhealthy consumer and business balance sheets\n. Job creation, while\ncooling\n, also\nremains positive\n, and the Federal Reserve ‚Äî having\nresolved the inflation crisis\n‚Äî\nshifted its focus toward supporting the labor market\n.\nBut growth is cooling\n: While the economy remains healthy, growth has\nnormalized\nfrom much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is\nless \"coiled\"\nthese days as\nmajor tailwinds like excess job openings\nand\ncore capex orders\nhave faded. It has become\nharder to argue\nthat growth is destiny.\nActions speak louder than words\n: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data\ndecoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data\n. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor‚Äôs perspective,\nwhat matters\nis that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\nStocks are not the economy\n: There‚Äôs a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could\noutperform the U.S. economy\nin the near term, thanks largely to\npositive operating leverage\n. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with\nstrategic layoffs\nand\ninvestment in new equipment\n, including hardware\npowered by AI\n. These moves are resulting in\npositive operating leverage\n, which means a modest amount of sales growth ‚Äî in the cooling economy ‚Äî is\ntranslating to robust earnings growth\n.\nMind the ever-present risks\n: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will\nalways be risks to worry about\n, such as\nU.S. political uncertainty\n,\ngeopolitical turmoil\n,\nenergy price volatility\n, and\ncyber attacks\n. There are also the dreaded\nunknowns\n. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\nInvesting is never a smooth ride\n: There‚Äôs also the harsh reality that\neconomic recessions\nand\nbear markets\nare developments that all long-term investors\nshould expect\nas they build wealth in the markets.\nAlways keep your stock market seat belts fastened\n.\nThink long-term\n: For now, there‚Äôs no reason to believe there‚Äôll be a challenge that the economy and the markets\nwon‚Äôt be able to overcome\nover time.\nThe long game remains undefeated\n, and it‚Äôs a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\nFor more on how the macro story is evolving, check out the\nprevious review of the macro crosscurrents. ¬ª\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co\nVisualizza commenti\nCondizioni\ne\nInformativa sulla privacy\nYour Privacy Choices\nCA Privacy Notice\nMore Info\nStorie consigliate\nCopyright ¬© 2025 Yahoo.
