The Dow was down 150 points, or 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite, which is far more concentrated with tech, was up 0.1%.\nFor the Nasdaq, it’s on track for its tenth record close in 11 sessions. It’s risen 21 of the past 21 trading days, which would be the most daily gains in a 25-day span for the index since July 2020.\nTopics\nCryptocurrencies\nData\nMagazine\nMarkets\nStock Picks\nBarron's Live\nRoundtable\nBarron's Stock Screen\nPersonal Finance\nStreetwise\nAdvisor Directory\nMemberships\nSubscribe to Barron's\nTools\nSaved Articles\nWatchlist\nNewsletters\nVideo Center\nCustomer Service\nCustomer Center\nNetwork\nThe Wall Street Journal\nMarketWatch\nInvestor's Business Daily\nMansion Global\nFinancial News London\nDow Jones Smart Money\nNewsstand\nBuy Issues\nReprints\nE-Edition\nFor Business\nCorporate Subscriptions\nFor Education\nInvesting in Education\nFor Advertisers\nPress & Media Inquiries\nAdvertising\nAccount\nSign In\nSubscriber Benefits\nManage Notifications\nManage Alerts\nAbout Barron's\nLive Events\nCentennial\nPrivacy Notice\nCookie Notice\nCopyright Policy\nAccessibility\nData Policy\nYour Ad Choices\nTerms of Use\nCommunity Rules\nBarron's Archive\nCopyright © 2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
