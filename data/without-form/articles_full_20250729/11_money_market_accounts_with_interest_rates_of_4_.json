Here’s what you need to know about money market accounts before opening one.\nWhat is a money market account?\nMoney market accounts help you achieve your short-term savings goals faster due to a higher annual percentage yield (APY) than regular savings or checking accounts. Plus, this type of account provides easy access to your funds, along with some of the best features of a checking account, such as debit cards and check-writing capabilities.\nLearn more:\nWhat is a money market account, and how does it work?\nIs a money market account a savings account?\nA money market account is a type of deposit account that typically pays a higher yield than most traditional savings accounts and may come with a debit card and check-writing privileges. Although, like a savings account, there may be limitations on how much you can withdraw and how often. You can certainly use a money market account to grow your savings, but it isn’t the same thing as a savings account.\nLearn more:\nIs a money market account a savings account?\nHow often do money market accounts pay interest?\nLike other interest-bearing deposit accounts, MMAs compound the interest you earn. Interest typically compounds daily and gets credited to your balance monthly (though this is not always the case). Compounding interest increases your APY because interest accrues not only on your principal balance, but on the interest you've accrued so far.\nLearn more:\nHow often do money market accounts pay interest?\nCurrent money market rates\nThe current average savings account rate is just 0.38%, and the average money market rate is 0.59%, according to the FDIC. However, there are money market accounts that pay much more — as high as 4% APY or more.\nLearn more:\nWhat is the national average money market account rate?\nExample benefits of high money market rates\nBecause money market bank account rates vary widely, it's important to choose an account with a competitive rate. This allows your money to grow faster.\nHere's how much you could earn if you deposited $10,000 into an account with one of the highest money market rates instead of a traditional savings account (assumes interest is compounded daily and credited monthly):\nHow much is a money market account minimum balance?\nMinimum balance requirements can vary. In some cases, you may need to meet a certain minimum balance or initial deposit requirement to avoid a monthly fee or earn interest.\nLearn more:\nHow much is a money market account minimum balance?\nAre money market accounts insured by the FDIC?\nLike other deposit accounts, the funds in your money market account are typically federally insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Both the FDIC and NCUA offer $250,000 in coverage per institution, per depositor, per ownership category. That should cover most people, but individuals with high net worths may need to spread out their funds across multiple institutions to maximize their protection.\nLearn more:\nAre money market accounts FDIC-insured?\nCan you lose money in a money market account?\nMoney market accounts are generally safe, and you usually can’t lose your principal deposit. However, there are some instances when you could lose money. For instance, fees and rising inflation can potentially eat into your account balance.\nLearn more:\nCan you lose money in a money market account?\nMoney market account vs. high-yield savings account\nMoney market accounts and HYSAs are two types of accounts you can use to grow your savings. They’re secure accounts backed by the FDIC or NCUA, and they both provide higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts do differ in several significant ways.\nLearn more:\nMMAs vs. high-yield savings accounts\nMoney market account vs. CD\nMoney market accounts and CDs are both deposit accounts that tend to offer higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, money market accounts offer greater access to your funds than a CD. CDs offer a high APY in exchange for locking up your funds for a set period of time.\nLearn more:\nMMAs vs. CDs\nMoney market account vs. money market fund\nMoney market funds and money market accounts may sound like the same thing, but they differ in a few key ways. Money market funds are not deposit accounts; they're a type of investment fund that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a basket of securities, such as stocks or bonds. A money market account, on the other hand, is a type of deposit account offered by many major banks and credit unions that typically pays a higher interest rate than traditional savings or checking accounts. MMAs may also come with a debit card, ATM card, and check-writing privileges.\nLearn more:\nMMAs vs. money market funds\nHow to open a money market account\nOpening a money market account is a fairly straightforward process. Once you’ve explored the account options offered by various financial institutions, you’ll need to gather some documentation. This may include your Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Tax Identification Number (TIN), government-issued ID, and proof of address. Once you have these documents in hand, you can begin your account application. This can be done in person, or in many cases, over the phone or online.\nLearn more:\nHow to open a money market account\nBest money market accounts methodology\nOur grading system, collected and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts, comprised more than 100 data points for close to 20 federally insured money market accounts to develop our list of the top 10 best money market accounts.\nWe evaluated these accounts according to several key metrics, including APY, minimum opening deposit, minimum balance requirements, monthly fees, interest compounding frequency, and more.\nThe accounts on our list could earn a maximum of 30 points across all metrics. Here’s a closer look at the categories we considered:\nMonthly fees:\nMany money market accounts charge a monthly maintenance or service fee. We rewarded accounts with no monthly fees.\nMinimum opening deposit:\nMany money market accounts require a minimum deposit to open an account. Accounts with no or low minimum deposit requirements ranked more favorably than those with higher opening deposit requirements.\nAnnual percentage yield (APY):\nAccounts with higher APYs were rewarded with more points than those with lower APYs. Note that rates on our list are current at the time of publishing, but are subject to change at any time.\nMinimum balance to earn interest:\nSome banks and credit unions require a minimum balance to earn the advertised rate. We favored accounts that had no or low minimum balance requirements.\nAccess to funds:\nMany money market accounts offer easier access to your funds through check-writing, debit card, or ATM card privileges. We awarded extra points to the accounts that offered these features.\nWithdrawals per month or statement cycle:\nMany banks limit the number of free withdrawals or transfers you can make from your money market account each month or statement cycle. We rewarded those accounts that didn’t set any limitations with extra points.\nCompounding frequency:\nCompounding can occur daily, monthly, quarterly, or even annually. We awarded more points to accounts that compound interest frequently.\nOverdraft fees:\nMany banks waive overdraft fees or do not charge fees at all if you overdraft your account. We awarded money market accounts that did not charge fees for overdrafts.\nRead More\nWeʼre unable to load stories right now.\nUp Next\nMoney market fund vs. high-yield savings​ account: Which option is better for your savings?\nAre money market accounts FDIC-insured?\nWhat is a jumbo money market account, and where can you find the best rates?\nCopyright © 2025 Yahoo.
